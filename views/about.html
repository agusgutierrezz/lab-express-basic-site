    <h1>A carrot cake story</h1>
    <p>
        know it can be a bold statement to call a recipe the best, but I truly mean it with this one. Not only is this carrot cake easy to make, but it’s so incredibly moist and full of flavor that it’s almost impossible to stop at one piece.

        You want to avoid packing the flour into the measuring cup, otherwise, you’ll end up with too much in your recipe.  Or if you have a food scale, you can also weigh your ingredients to get an accurate measurement.

I also really love some spice in my carrot cake so I use some ground cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.  All three spices add such a wonderful flavor to this cake, but aren’t too overpowering.  They really take this cake from good to absolutely amazing, trust me.
